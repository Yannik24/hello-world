# hello-world
My first GitHub Repository
I am Sitting in Torgerson right now, waiting for my JAVA Lab
I missed Chemistry class for the engineering expo
That was stupid. I went to SpaceX and they turned me away because im a freshman and 17, and not because I am not qualified for an internship.
That was very disappointing. I was looking forward to the prospect of working under Elon Musk. 
Oh well, Work hard until your idols become your rivals
